K-means is an [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) method, which means that it doesn't need to have \"true\" labels or examples to learn a pattern. Instead, this class of algorithms can be described as pattern recognizers in the truest sense.\n",

    "A common theme in our discussion of machine learning so far is the fact that we try to build models of the world that can describe specific phenomena. We want to be able to extract the patterns encoded by our observations (data) to study how a process works and potentially predict how that process might work in the future. In the case of $k$-means, we seek to systematically extract information about the distribution of our data by answering questions like \"do our observations naturally form groups?\"\n",
