    "\n",
    "Today we want to look at ways to help buisnesses make the most out of their customers feedback, which oftentimes comes as textual reviews or comments. Sentiment Analysis, or categorizing attitudes towards something, is quite relevant today. Amazon, for example, sells products of all sorts; those who purchase these items are able to leave reviews and comments. Besides the ratings that are given, how would a company be able to tell which products are well-liked and which ones should be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way is through sentiment analysis, where the goal is to predict the sentiment or positivity/negativity of a product or service solely based on the text provided as comments and reviews. Throughout this lab, we will explore two different ways to predict and understand the sentiment of text data. First, we will work through a simple rule-based algorithm, looking at positive and negative words to determine the classification of reviews. Following this, we will work through a more sophisticated machine learning based approach, allowing us to scale our classification to much larger datasets."

With just a couple of extensions to our version (such as negation handling) we could actually make this production ready. However, the main drawback of this approach is that we need **hand engineered** lists of positive and negative expressions, which are non-trivial to create and also static. That means they don't adapt automatically to the domain they are being used for. For example, in formal language expressions might have different meaning than in a colloquial context. \n",
